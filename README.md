# esp8266-wifi

Sample code showing how to connect an ESP8266 to a wifi network. 
This code was tested on NodeMCU V3.
After connecting the code executes a ping to 1.1.1.1 every 5 seconds to check if the network is working.

## Dependency

The dependency to `dancol90/ESP8266Ping@^1.0` is only needed for doing ping.
